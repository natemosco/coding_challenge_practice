# Problem Description

You are given an unordered array consisting of consecutive integers [1, 2, 3, ..., n] without any duplicates. You are allowed to swap any two elements. You need to find the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in ascending order.

-   for example:

```
[4 3 1 2]
[2 3 1 4]
[2 1 3 4]
[1 2 3 4]

Total swaps = 3
```
